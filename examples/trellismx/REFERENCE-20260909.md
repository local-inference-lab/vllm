# September9 reference image and validation

This adds the measured reference's native FP8 route-hoist dispatch, tile policy,
K5 funnel and grouped FC2 modules. The generic dynamic.py is intentionally retained
from the reviewed PR head, including its direct-input block-offset helper and
M16 rejection. The native wrapper selects separate route_hoist_dynamic.py.
No checkpoint reencoding or BF16 expert-MMA substitution is included.

Selected runtime image: verdictai/trellismx:glm53-flash-p8-r27-reference-20260909@sha256:ca6b80188dce154b91f49108b7d87792d2ba6328935afc71b44d1c0e6f6a1adf.

Full-model speed/KLD evidence belongs to the immutable selected image, not a fresh
GPU run of this PR checkout. Generic path retained from prior reviewed head differs
from the selected image; no claim of complete PR/image source identity is made.

The companion B12X integration is pinned to d564f6ca54c092497ec5ae7e07a272f55eec7dbe. This vLLM PR updates existing integration examples; it does not duplicate an upstream PR. Published image source overlays and current PR source are separately identified.

Current checkout CPU validation: 31 quantization tests passed; 39 distributed tests
passed and 21 GPU-only cases skipped; companion B12X contract tests 24 passed.
Command: `B12X_SOURCE=/path/to/pinned/b12x bash examples/trellismx/check_cpu_r27.sh`.
Pre-commit passed for all seven changed example/documentation files.
